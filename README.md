# Martian CIDR

Check if an IP address is from reserved subnet.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arty-name/martian-cidr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/arty-name/martian-cidr)

[Certain IP subnets are reserved for special-use by Internet Assigned Numbers 
Authority (IANA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses). A 
[Martian packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_packet) is an IP packet which specifies 
a source or destination address from such subnet. If seen on the public internet, 
these packets cannot actually originate as claimed, or be delivered.

You can check if some packet is a Martian packet like that:

```js
import isMartianIP from 'martian-cidr'
console.log(isMartianIP('10.0.0.1')) // true
```
